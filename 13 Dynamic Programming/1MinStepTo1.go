// Given a positive integer 'n', find and return
//  the minimum number of steps that 'n' has to take to get
//  reduced to 1. You can perform any one of the following 3 steps:
// 1.) Subtract 1 from it. (n = n - ­1) ,
// 2.) If n is divisible by 2, divide by 2.( if n % 2 == 0, then n = n / 2 ) ,
// 3.) If n is divisible by 3, divide by 3. (if n % 3 == 0, then n = n / 3 ).
